# Understanding Sitemaps

Learn about XML sitemaps and why they're important for your website.

## What is a Sitemap?

A sitemap is a file that provides information about the pages, posts, and other content on your site. Search engines like Google use sitemaps to discover and index your content more efficiently.

## XML Sitemap Format

An XML sitemap typically includes:
- URLs of all pages on your site
- Last modification dates
- Update frequency
- Priority of pages

## Jekyll Sitemap Plugin

The `jekyll-sitemap` plugin automatically generates a sitemap for your Jekyll site. It:
- Scans all your pages and posts
- Creates a properly formatted `sitemap.xml` file
- Updates automatically when you build your site

## Benefits

Having a sitemap helps with:
1. **SEO**: Better search engine visibility
2. **Discovery**: Helps search engines find all your content
3. **Indexing**: Speeds up the indexing process
4. **Updates**: Notifies search engines of content changes
